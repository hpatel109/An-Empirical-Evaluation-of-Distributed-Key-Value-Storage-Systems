# An-Empirical-Evaluation-of-Distributed-Key-Value-Storage-Systems

Our case study is related to performance of storage systems. So, we send keyÂ­value pairs for insert, lookup and remove operations by Client API and every time we measure some parameters which decide the performance of specific storage system. There are two aspect which should be tested for: latency and query throughput.We used 16 instances on AWS to evaluate storage system.
